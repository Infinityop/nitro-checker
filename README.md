Discord Nitro Checker is a simple program written in Python that allows you to check a list of Discord tokens for the presence of Nitro. The program uses multithreading to speed up the process and can check up to 100 tokens simultaneously. Valid Nitro tokens are outputted to a 'nitro.txt' file, while invalid tokens are outputted to an 'invalid.txt' file.

To use the program, simply create a file called 'tokens.txt' and add your Discord tokens, one per line. Then run the program and specify the number of threads you want to use. The program will check each token and output the results to the appropriate files.
